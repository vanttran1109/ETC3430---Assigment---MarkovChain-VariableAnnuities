## Variable Annuity Pricing

The goal of this project is to calculate the appropriate price of a variable annuity for policyholders based on their age and their choice of investment options.

## Overview

In this assignment, we provide two sets of data: historical returns of defensive and growth investment options, and a survey of 1000 individuals over 40 years with their health status (healthy, ill-health, or deceased).

The student is tasked with deriving probability transition matrices for both the investment returns and the health status using the Monte Carlo method to simulate new data. The calculated matrices are then used in the life insurance pricing formulas to determine the pricing for each age cohort.

In addition to the calculations, careful investigation is conducted into the limitations and assumptions of the method employed.

## Tools Used

No external packages were utilized in this assignment. All calculations were implemented by the student from scratch.

## Results

This project provides the student with valuable insights into the process of analyzing data and calculating the pricing for a product. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations and assumptions associated with the chosen methodology.
